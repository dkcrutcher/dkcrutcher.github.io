         <h2> About Me</h2>
        <br>
    <p>As a mechanical engineer, I hope to utilize my skills and experience to help build a better community. To be more specific, I've witnessed while growing up, that the sense of discipline and hard work has become more jaded in your youth, and there are opportunities that these student's, either don't know about, or don't want to take advantage of to help them better their education and technical skills. At the same time, I can see that the youth of your nation is growing an aptitude for technology and they have the potential to grow.
</p>
        <br>
        <p>
   I want to focus my engineering skills in the areas of automotive and transportation technology, state resource management, and or medical technology. And use the technical experience I gain from that, to bring in the youth of our community, and help to build up our nation's engineers so they have a chance to make a difference in their own lives, the lives of their families, and the life that breathes within our nation </p>
        
        <br> 
        
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <br>
        <p>

            In high school, I've created my own non-profit organization called Cans4Care. This organization utilized recycled to create profit, which would then be used to support other non-profit organizations and student scholarships. This taught me how to be a leader to others, how to manage a company, speak to clients, and the importance of mentorship in our community.

</p>
        <br>

        <p>What initially inspired me to become an engineering was my time spent at the Flabob airport, which was also my high school. I spent my Saturdays and some time after school gaining experience with working with my hands on by being a part of the Flabob Build-a-Plane project, where we were building a full sized stits skycoupe, and stension aircraft. I spent a good 3 years of my high school experience building these aircraft with my fellow group members, learning manufacturing skill and utilizing tools such as a lathe, bandsaw, polyfiber stitching and construction, and more. </p>
<br>

<p>I also spent my time learning the basics of flight while taking flight lessons to work toward my pilot's license</p>
<br>

<p>I got accepted into the University of California, Davis in 2013, and plan to graduate in 2018 as a mechanical engineer. As great and as valuable as my experience was in high school, I wasn't able to have everything I needed to prepare me for college, in fact, I'm the first one on my father's side of the family and the only one in my immediate family to go to college. So I had to start from the lowest sections of core classes offered at Davis, for math, phyisics, writing, and chemistry. My advisors told me that most students who start at my level change majors or drop out, but I was determined to succeed.</p>

<br>
<p>I got a job as a UC Davis Aggie Host Security Guard in Dec 2014 and left in Feb 2017 as schools became more demanding. My duties were to serve as a point of security and safety for the students of UCD, drive for the UC Davis Safe Ride Studend Escort Program, as well as act as a dispatcher. The job taught me invaluable lesson in leadership, how to handle potentially life threatening situations, and most importantly the value of being a part of a strong team</p>
<br>

In Feb 2016 I achieved a new position as a student manager at the UC Davis Engineering Student Startup Center, later I got a promotion with the title of the Workshop Coordinator for the Engineering Student Startup Center. The goal of the center was to give the students the resources the need to make a successful startup company, by helping them network with potential clients, helping them to develop a business plan, and teach them rapid prototyping technical skills to quickly create their products. My role was to create the content of these workshops, reach out to speakers for seminars, manage the workshop times and instructors, and manage and maintain the technology that these workshops utilize. 
        <br>
<br>

<p>The Center features technology in 3D printing, CNC milling, HTML and CSS programming, Arduino and C programming, 3D modeling, motion tracking, and robotics. All these technologies were free for the students to use, and came with workshops that I have personally built or instructed. Through instructing, managing, maintaining and even building, I have gained a lot of experience working with 3D printers. I've helped students develop their own products by helping them create CAD models with Solidworks and print them out, I've helped senior design students create prototypes for the senior design projects, I've even helped students and professors with their research by helping them create projects here.</p>
<br>
        <p>The skills I've learned at this job has easily helped me with my school work, and my club experience by constantly presenting me with new challenges in both engineering and administrative work. This website, for example is an extension of my need to learn HTML and CSS for my job. I'm going to become the main Arduino instructor for the UC Davis space and Satellite Systems club this coming school year, because of my experience with creating Arduino projects and teaching Arduino workshops, and my CAD modeling experience has come in had for my involvement with the UCD Solar car club.</p>
