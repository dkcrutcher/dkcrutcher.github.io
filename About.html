         <h2> About Me</h2>
        <div class="aboutMeText">
        <br>
    <p  style="text-align:justify"> What got me started on my career path toward engineering was my involvment with the Flabob airport where I had the opportunity to build full scale airplanes from the ground up. I was amazed at the fact that someone was able to figure out how to make these giant heaps of metal and fabric fly, and I wanted to learn how the engineering processe worked to build my own ideas. When I attended college, I've been fortunate enough to participate in a variety of experiences such as leadership positions in my schools Hyperloop team, teaching workshops in rapid prototyping technologies, and programming different types of feedback controllers for a robotics lab just to name a few. After all these experieneces I now find myself wanting to learn more, and as I enter industry I hope to discover even greater challenges.  </p>
        <br>
        
        <br> 
        
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <br>
       

            

        <br>
<p style="text-align:justify">I was fortunate enough to attend a charter school that was located on the site of the Flabob Airport in Riverside, CA. At the airport, we were encouraged to participate in aviation based programs that were offered by the airport's board of directors. I spent most Saturdays and time after school participating Flabob Build-a-Plane project.  My team and I built a Stits Skycoupe airplane as well as worked on a Stenson model.  In this we were introduced to the world of aircraft manufacturing, getting hands on fabrication experience utilizing tools such as a lathe, bandsaw, polyfiber stitching and construction, and more. </p>
<br>


            <p style="text-align:justify"> In my sophomore year of college I worked as a security guard in order to make ends meet while taking classes. In Feb 2016, I obtained a new position as Student Manager at the UC Davis Engineering Student Startup Center where I worked Workshop Coordinator/Mechanical Design Consultant and Fabricator. The goal of the center is to give students the resources needed to make a successful startup company by helping them network with potential clients, helping them to develop a business model, and teach them rapid prototyping technical skills to quickly create their products.  While drafting material for my rapid prototyping technologies workshops I was able to gain skills in CAD model design with SolidWorks, basic arduino programming, and fabrication of mechanical designs as well as electrical prototypes.  </p>
       
<br>

<p style="text-align:justify">The Center features technology in 3D printing, CNC milling, HTML and CSS programming, Arduino and C++ programming, 3D modeling, motion tracking, and robotics.  All of these technologies are free for the students and come with workshops that I have personally drafted and taught. Through instructing, managing, maintaining and even building, I have gained a lot of experience working with 3D printers.  I've helped students develop their own products by helping them create CAD models with Solidworks and print them out; I've helped senior design students create prototypes, and finalize designs for their senior design projects. I've even assisted students and professors with their research at the center. </p>
<br>
        <p style="text-align:justify">The skills I've gained while working at the Center, have helped me with my school work and my club experience by constantly presenting me with new challenges in both engineering and administrative work.  This website, for example is an extension of my need to learn HTML and CSS for my job. I later gained the position of the Eddy Brake Sub-Lead for our schools hyperloop team where I lead a group of 13 students divided into two separate teams, the design team and the research team. Here I learned about guiding a multidisciplinary group of engineers to work together toward a collaborative design under my instruction. What we built was a Magnetic braking assembly for our hyperloop pod. I was not only able to deepen my leadership skills but also my mechanical design and fabrication skills, and my FEA abilities. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p style="text-align:justify"> Over this past Summer I gained experience working in the real-world bay area startup culture by working as an intern for Chirp Microsystems where I was in charge of designing and fabricating test setup designs for ultrasonic sensors at the company Chirp Microsystems. At this company I performed redesigns on these ultrasonic sensors to improve their functionality, I also had to learn how to use the software KiCAD for a couple of my designs to make PCB’s that was used to connect our sensors to our computer to collect data while keeping the apparatus flexible for quick and rapid testing. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p style="text-align:justify"> Now, during my last quarter at UCD, I work as an undergraduate researcher for a human to machine interfacing lab lead by UC Davis' Professor Moore in which my job is to design feedback loop controllers for a double pendulum robot that was designed as a simplified model of a human on a moving cart. These different controller models allowed us to see how this robot would be able to balance vertically or stick to a defined movement algorithm as a function of time while receiving randomized inputs from a motorized cart. Tuning our controllers and making and fabricating modifications for the double pendulum robot was only a few parts of my job. I was also in charge of making the controller interface more interactive by designing GUIs that allowed the user to send different controller values and algorithms through a serial port using the IDE "Processing" to interface with the Arduino Mega that functioned as the robot’s microcontroller.</p>
