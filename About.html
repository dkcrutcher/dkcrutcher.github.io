         <h2> About Me</h2>
        <br>
    <p>As a mechanical engineer, I hope to utilize my skills and experience to help build a better community. To be more specific, while growing up, I observed that a significant number of my peers lack discipline and good work ethic work.   There are lot of opportunities that these students either don't know about, or are intimidated by and are hesitant to take advantage of to help better their education and technical skills. At the same time, I can see that the youth of our nation is growing an aptitude for technology and they have the potential to grow. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
   I want to focus my engineering skills in the areas of automotive and transportation technology, state resource management, and/or medical technology.  I hope to use the knowledge and experience I gain to mentor those who need guidance in the world of engineering.</p>
        
        <br> 
        
        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <br>
        <p>

            In high school, I've created my own non-profit organization called Cans4Care. This organization utilized recycled to create profit, which would then be used to support other non-profit organizations and student scholarships. This taught me how to be a leader to others, how to manage a company, speak to clients, and the importance of mentorship in our community.

</p>
        <br>

        <p>I was fortunate to attend a charter school that was located on an airport property in Riverside, CA, called Flabob Airport.  We were encouraged to participate in air-related programs that were offered by the airport's board of directors.  It was there that I was inspired to become an engineer.  I spent most Saturdays and time after school gaining aviation experience by being part of the Flabob Build-a-Plane project.  My team and I participated in building a full sized Stits Skycoupe and Stenson aircraft.  We were also introduced to the world of aircraft manufacturing, utilizing tools such as a lathe, bandsaw, polyfiber stitching and construction, and more. </p>
<br>

<p>One of the more special privileges was being chose to join a select few students who were members of a group called Young Eagles.  We participated in airshows working the ramp and educating the public about some of the aircraft, including the airport's prized DC3.  I was also thrilled to be able to learning the basics of flight while taking flight lessons as I worked toward obtaining my pilot's license.</p>
<br>

<p>In my final year of high school in 2013, I was accepted by the University of California, Davis and plan to graduate in 2018 as a Mechanical Engineer.  As great and as valuable as my experience was in high school, I wasn't fully prepared for college with regard to core classes.  So I had to start from the lowest sections of core classes offered at Davis, for math, physics, writing, and chemistry.  My advisors told me that most students who start at my level change majors or drop out, but I was determined to succeed.</p>

<br>
<p>I got a job as a UC Davis Aggie Host Security Guard in Dec 2014 and left in Feb 2017 as school became more demanding.  My duties were to serve as a point of security and safety for the students of UCD, drive for the UC Davis Safe Ride Student Escort Program, as well as act as a dispatcher.  The job taught me invaluable lessons in leadership, how to handle potentially life threatening situations, and most importantly the value of being part of a strong team</p>
<br>

In Feb 2016 I obtained a new position as Student Manager at the UC Davis Engineering Student Startup Center.  I was later promoted to Workshop Coordinator for the Engineering Student Startup Center. The goal of the center is to give students the resources needed to make a successful startup company by helping them network with potential clients, helping them to develop a business plan, and teach them rapid prototyping technical skills to quickly create their products.  My role is to create the content of these workshops, reach out to speakers for seminars, manage the workshop times and instructors, and manage and maintain the technology that these workshops utilize. 
        <br>
<br>

<p>The Center features technology in 3D printing, CNC milling, HTML and CSS programming, Arduino and C programming, 3D modeling, motion tracking, and robotics.  All of these technologies are free for the students and come with workshops that I have personally built and taught. Through instructing, managing, maintaining and even building, I have gained a lot of experience working with 3D printers.  I've helped students develop their own products by helping them create CAD models with Solidworks and print them out; I've helped senior design students create prototypes for the senior design projects; I've even assisted students and professors with their research by helping them create projects here.</p>
<br>
        <p>The skills I've learned at this job have helped me with my school work and my club experience by constantly presenting me with new challenges in both engineering and administrative work.  This website, for example is an extension of my need to learn HTML and CSS for my job.  I'm going to become the main Arduino instructor for the UC Davis Space and Satellite Systems Club this coming school year.  This came about because of my experience with creating and teaching Arduino workshops, and my CAD modeling experience has come in handy for my involvement with the UCD Solar Car Club.</p>
