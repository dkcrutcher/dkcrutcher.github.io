         I've had the pleasure of learning how to construct desktop 3D printers. The printers I've had experience with utilizes repetier host, makerbot desktop, and the cura slicing engine as the software types for operating the printers. By working with a variety of different students from different backgrounds, I have been able to gain a lot of applicable practice with SolidWorks and AutoDesk 360 to help each student meet their design needs for their prototype.

            Troubleshooting printers from different manufactures all come with their own unique challenges, some hardware based, some software, and some a mixture of the two. Learning how to deal with this everytime a problem arises has taught me a lot about GCODE language, thinking creatively to handle different problems like 3D printing parts to act as placeholders for broken parts for example.

    <p class="projectText" >  The UC Davis Hyperloop Design team aims to participate in Elon Musk's Hyperloop Competition where we hope to build a pod that will travel the fastest in a vacuum sealed tube while competing against other colleges in this exciting endeavor. I am a sub-leader for the eddy brake system of the hyperloop pod. Eddy brakes are magnetic brakes that work off of the eddy effect that occurs when a non-magnetic metallic object passes through a magnetic field. I lead a sub-team consisting of 12 members organized into a design team, a controls team, and a research team. My hope for this group is not only to create a successful magnetic braking system for the pod, but also that each member of my sub team gains the valuable engineering experience in being a part of a multidisciplinary team and building something from concept to creation.</p>

    <p align="center" class="projectText"> I've definitley enjoyed my time as a sublead for the Hyperloop Team at UC Davis. During my time as a sublead, I've created a resarch team who looks the conceptual parameters that help to govern our design for the eddy braking system, and conduct experiemnts using an aluminum wheel setup coupled with a PASCO box to help our team determine the strength of our neodynium mangetic brakes. I've also created a Design Drafting team who has worked together nicely to go through iteration after iteration of a working design for our Eddy Brake System. Being their lead has driven me to learn new skills, technologies and software that I probably wouldn't have learned how to utilize otherwise. Both by leading this group, and working alongside my team members I've learned how to utlize ANSYS finite element Analysis, New Levels of SolidWorks, Fusion 360 CAM software, Lazer Cutting Technologes, Fatigue analysis, and more. 
        <br> 
        The image to the left is a working design of our Eddy Braking system. This system utilizes the eddy effect which works off of Lenz's Law, which basically states that magnetic fields don't like change. The change in this case is an aluminum I beam moving through the field. Eddy Currents are produced in this I beam and these currents produce their own magnetic field, which induces a braking effect. This phenomenon will be used to slow down our Pod from high speeds without wearing down any of our components with physical contact.</p>

This internship enabled me to learn how design parts on the scale of microns, and work with extremeley small tolerences. I was also able to gain real world experience in PCB design. I with the help of my co-workers and online forums I was able to learn how to navigate the environment of KiCad, and design my very own PCB for one our test assemblies.

In my last quarter of college, I had the opportunity to work in a lab that conducts research in machine to human interface. My job was to design controllers for a double pendulum robot that was designed as a simplified model of a human on a moving cart. These different controller models allowed us to see how this robot would be able to balance vertically or stick to a defined path of movement while receiving randomized inputs from a motorized cart. Tuning our controllers and making and fabricating modifications for the double pendulum robot was only a few parts of my job. I was also in charge of making the controller interface more interactive by designing GUIs that allowed the user to send different controller values and algorithms through a serial port using the IDE Processing to interface with the Arduino Mega that functioned as the robot’s microcontroller.   </p>
